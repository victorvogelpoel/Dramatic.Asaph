LONG DESCRIPTION
	Asaph version 1.0 

	Asaph is a micro-blogging system, focusing on collecting links and images from other pages.
	It allows you to post content directly from any page you are on. Asaph is not a full blown blog 
	and it does not aim to be one — it just does this one task, but it's pretty good at it.

	Stickney Theme for Asaph The alternative Stickney Theme also shows date and author information 
	for each post and allows posting of longer texts. Feel free to modify these themes to your 
	liking, or create new ones.

	The Asaph author's blog can be found at asaph.phoboslab.org.

	Requirements & Installation
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Asaph needs PHP 5.0 or higher with the GD-lib installed and cURL or
	allow_url_fopen enabled. Also MySQL 4.0 or higher and an already created
	database is needed. To post entries to your blog, you'll need a good
	browser (read: anything not Internet Explorer).

	To install, enter your database and server settings in the
	lib/asaph_config.class.php file. The settings you absolutely need to 
	change are $domain, $absolutePath and $db. You also have the option to 
	switch from the minimalist whiteout templates to the stickney templates 
	by just replacing both occurrences of "whiteout" with "stickney" in the 
	$templates setting.

	When done, upload all files to your server and make sure the data/
	directory is writable - this is where Asaph stores all images and 
	thumbnails. After that, point your browser to admin/install.php and 
	follow the instructions.

	Usage / Posting
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The only way to post new entries to your Asaph blog, is through a 
	bookmarklet. After logging in to your admin menu, you will see the ASAPH
	bookmarklet on the left. Just drag this link to your bookmarks bar and
	you're set. 

	Now, navigate your browser to any page you want and click your newly 
	created bookmark. A small box should pop up and all images on the page
	should now have a dashed blue border (if not, see the FAQ). You can now 
	either click on any of these images or on "Post this Site" to post the
	image or link.
